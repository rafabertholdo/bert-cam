- **Services**: Core functionality for camera and audio handling

### Key Components

- `CameraService`: Handles camera setup, recording, and audio input management
- `CameraViewModel`: Manages the app's state and user interactions
- `ContentView`: Main view containing the camera preview and controls
- `RecordButton`: Custom record button with animations and state handling
- `AudioInputPickerView`: Interface for selecting audio input sources
